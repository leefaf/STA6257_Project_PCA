	Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning Methods. In our research, we learn that the applications of how important and groundbreaking Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning Methods. In these papers we see how promising the impact is of PCA 
with recognizing Microanerysm in medicine and how ground breaking has been in critical for diagnosis and treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy.
Other research papers show framework for coronary artery disease risk assessment in intravascular ultrasound. The paper reflects on a novel strategy for risk stratification based on plaque morphology embedded with principal component analysis (PCA) for plaque feature dimensionality reduction and dominant feature selection technique.
Facial recognition with PCA and machine learning methods, From the this Paper the authors have identified that the best way to compare and evaluate the Facial Recognition results with speed and accuracy was with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and as well as Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Lastly we see the importance of PCA with it  identifiying that the best way to compare and evaluate the Facial Recognition results with speed and accuracy was with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and as  well as Support Vector Machine (SVM).
