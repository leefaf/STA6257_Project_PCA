How PCA is used 

PCA is a tool for identifying the main axes of variance within a data set and allows for easy data exploration to understand the key variables in the data and spot outliers. Properly applied, it is one of the most powerful tools in the data analysis tool kit.
PCA forms the basis of multivariate data analysis based on projection methods. The most important use of PCA is to represent a multivariate data table as smaller set of variables (summary indices) to observe trends, jumps, clusters and outliers. This overview may uncover the relationships between observations and variables, and among the variables.
Statistically, PCA finds lines, planes and hyper-planes in the K-dimensional space that approximate the data as well as possible in the least squares sense. A line or plane that is the least squares approximation of a set of data points makes the variance of the coordinates on the line or plane as large as possible.
